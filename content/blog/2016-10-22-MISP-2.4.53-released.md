A new version [2.4.53](https://github.com/MISP/MISP/tree/v2.4.53) of MISP including several security fixes has been released.

We strongly recommend to update to this latest version as soon as possible.

The release also includes new features like:

- A new CSV import module in the feed feature.
- Quick search when adding new tags (via the tag interface).
- Some improvements in the custom authentication (e.g. reverse proxy authentication).
- Many UI improvement.

Last but not least, multiple bugs were fixed. We thank all contributors, bug reporters and especially Vytautas Paulikas and Robert Giruckas from SEC Consult
for their security review.
