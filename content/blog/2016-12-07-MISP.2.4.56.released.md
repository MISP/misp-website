A new version of MISP [2.4.56](https://github.com/MISP/MISP/tree/v2.4.56) has been released, including bug fixes and improvements.

This is the first version introducing the [misp-galaxy](https://github.com/MISP/misp-galaxy). MISP galaxy is a simple method to express
large objects called cluster that can be attached to MISP events or (in the near future) attributes. A cluster can be composed of one or more elements, 
which are expressed as key-value pairs. You can now directly benefit from the shared galaxy with threat actors and tools used by attackers in MISP.

The release includes various improvements such as:

- [modules] Added the possibility to specify a "type" instead of a list of "types" in the enrichment modules.
- Significant improvements in the Bro export format and process.
- Improvements of the discussion/posts.
