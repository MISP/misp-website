A new version of MISP [2.4.67](https://github.com/MISP/MISP/tree/v2.4.67) has been released, including improvements to the sighting feature, user management and activity visualisation.

Sighting activities over tags and galaxy clusters are now visualised using sparklines, giving us an interesting outlook of contextual activity:

Advanced sighting activity is now available at the event level to view the summary of sightings submitted at the attribute level.

Significant updates to the user-management interface have been undertaken, allowing users to see their respective organisation admin, PGP status overview including fingerprint and the validity of the key.
These improvements were introduced following the feedback of some MISP administrators operating large information sharing communities.

Lots of bugs fixed and small improvement were added.

A big thank you to all of the users who gave feedback and to the contributors who have helped us to improve MISP. A special thank you to all users who are not afraid of submitting pull-request on the
various MISP projects (from core to taxonomies) to improve MISP and support the growing community of users.

The full change log is available [here](https://www.misp.software/Changelog.txt).
