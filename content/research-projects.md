## The Social Perspective in Intelligence Activity Among Information Sharing Communities

## Introduction

## (1) Subject scope

Intelligence activity is a common practice shared among different fields. The practice of intelligence evolved to adapt to the evolution of human societies. The transition from analog to digital introduced changes in social practices and communications.

Transmission of information is a key element to intelligence activity, as such a subject of studies in anthropology and social sciences. The subject scope is to analyse the social activities among sharing communities, in order to understand and describe the practices of information exchange.

### (1.1) The interest in studying information sharing

Information sharing has become a key in our societies effectiveness, as in facing information warfare.

Many studies and researches in the field of information security and intelligence focused mainly (cf. state-of-the-art) on the practical, the standardisation, the usage perspective and the technical aspects of information sharing, without an analysis of its social or cultural aspects.

### (1.2) Intelligence and information sharing in the age of online criminal activities, study of group and practices

Information sharing plays a key role in law enforcement investigations and especially to track and take-down criminal activities. Efficient information exchange ensure resolution and prosecution in a timely fashion. Information strongly relies on the existence of sharing communities among law enforcement and intelligence.

## (2) Problem statement

We lack some opportunities to make successful sharing among the community of research. In order to tackle this issue, we must first understand how information sharing happen.

### (2.1) State of the Art

An extensive review has been performed in the field of information sharing. A significant number of academic papers focused on the structure of information and especially the tools used. A majority of the researches focus on a niche in intelligence, such as building competitive analysis or structuring data exchange.

In the bibliography, we reviewed papers which are related to the main information sharing platform MISP, which will allow us to meet and interview groups who are actively performing information sharing.

### (2.2) Fundamental question

Does the existence of the information depend on the existence of the community?

## (3) Research methodology

### (3.1) Research design

We assume that we can observe replicates of social practices from real to digital environment, and a specific set of practices on sharing platforms such as MISP ("people need to make sense out of it").

A serie of interviews will be conducted among sharing communities. We are interested in the comparison between usages of the platform that we observe, in one hand, and what people can tell us about it, in the other hand.

We assume that both technical observations, as statistics from the platform, and qualitative observations from the interviews can reveal “abnormal” behaviors from participants.

As a starting point, a list of reasons are included below in the section "Example list".

We narrow our questioning about the following points:

- Common assumed (survey) reasons why organisations are not sharing
- Common reasons why organisations are sharing

In order to integrate as much data as possible and to avoid pre-interview categorization, we will perform free interviews.

In this case, the observer is a participant : an interview is a conversation between two “analysts”. The participant and the researcher agree on the meaning of words, they use during the conversation. The idea is to note these keywords definitions and update their meaning during the research.

Keywords here can illustrate or reflect social practices among the community, and help in creating a first set of variables. Those initial “variables” can be used to discover reasons (explanations of behaviors) or new parameters (unknown reasons) which can emerge after additional interviews, and can be used as a first set of constants for further analysis.

#### Example list

Common reasons why organisations are not sharing (ref. Goldenberg, I., Soeters, J. and Dean, W.H. eds.,) as an example list:

- Lack of trust within the community
- Cultural reason (language)
- Cultural reason (geopolitical)
- Prideness (my information is so critical, so I don't share it)
- Shame on the information owned (cannot share because it's not interesting in their point-of-view)
- Don't see the benefit of sharing
- Not used to share information
- Don't share information in communities (only ad-hoc mode - email/phone/conf call)

Common reasons why organisations are sharing:

- Increasing cohesion (positive effect on the community)
- Create common approaches (such as: context, data model, predictability)
- Increase network and partnership (it increases trust)
- Cross-checking (creates a validation or counter analysis)


### (3.2) Data analysis model

- Collecting structured information from sharing platforms (e.g. MISP data to refine or use existing)
- Interviews (unstructured or semi-structured model) [^2]

Structured information from sharing platforms such as the type of information shared, the activity per organisations or the contextualisation applied.
Partially structured information from the interviews. Different data analysis will be applied especially to cross-check data from sharing platforms and the unstructured data collected from interviews.


### (3.3) Expected results and contribution

The research results will include the description of social practices which participate to information sharing.

Our goal is to discover, elaborate and test social models to qualify specific aspects.

- The distinction between producing and conveying[^1] organisations (producing and sharing participants can be different)
- The description of the context surrounding the production and sharing of an information
- The description of sharing dynamics in sharing communities
- An exploration of factors to improve sharing

These qualifications can be then used to improve detection mechanisms within organisations.

### (4) Conclusion

The research results might be impacted by the following parameters:

- Risk of too much diversity (heterogeneous) in dataset
- Tampered/false information from the sharing communities
- Limited dataset (representativity) on specific sharing communities
- Potential strong deviation from standards
- Inability to collect data due to the confidentiality level of specific sharing communities

# Project (3) Secure Distributed-Learning on Threat Intelligence - EPFL and armasuisse Science and Technology, Lausanne

Collaboration in the Framework of C4DT between armasuisse Science and Technology and the Laboratory for Data Security of EPFL.

Cyber security information is extremely sensitive and confidential. This introduces an information-sharing trade-off, between the benefits of improved threat-response capabilities and the drawbacks of disclosing national-security-related information to foreign agencies or institutions. The purpose of this project is to resolve the aforementioned trade-off by enabling secure collaborations with valuable sensitive data that is not normally shared. Each institution keeps full control over their data records, that never leave their security perimeter, whereas computations are protected by efficient and highly-scalable multiparty-homomorphic-encryption techniques. This will expand the range of available intelligence, thus leading to new and better threat analyses and predictions.
