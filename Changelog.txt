- Allow JSON POSTing to set parameters for the CSV export. [Iglocska]

  - kill the url parameters with fire

Fix
~~~
- Removed a duplicate ACL entry. [Iglocska]
- Clusters added don't have the exportable field set on the tag and
  because of that they don't show up on the API. [Iglocska]
- Updated to the latest version of PyMISP. [Alexandre Dulaunoy]
- Moved requeue of pull scheduled job to the front. [Iglocska]
- Fixed missing publish flag in restsearch. [Iglocska]

- Removed an accidentally added edit button. [Iglocska]
- Fixed an issue that incorrectly reported a feed update to have failed
  when not using delta-merge mode. [Iglocska]

  - the issue was that in the case of a feed update to a fixed event without delta merge, MISP tried to insert all parsed attributes, which correctly automatically blocked duplicates
  - however, since these attributes were blocked by the validator, the feed fetcher reported that the fetch didn't succeed as it contained validation errors

  - this fix simply runs non-delta merge mode updates through the comparisons to the existing event, removing duplicates in advance
- Fixed an issue that prevented the feeds from working in CSV mode if no
  value field was set. [Iglocska]
- Removed invalid entry in writeable file diagnostics. [Iglocska]

  a zip file with different files inside. - Changed the file extension
  of Bro export files from ".intel" to ".txt". - Removed the allowNonIDS
  option from the Bro export as it doesn’t make sense to have it (Bro is
  an IDS). - Fixed some of the API endpoints which were not accepted
  (ACL issues). - Added support for a list of events that should be /
  should not be included in the export. - Added a new "meta.desc" column

    - tie non admin functions into the APIs (maybe?)
    - reuse the new API system for other APIs
- First commit for the user API rework and the new response handler.
  [Iglocska]
- Show file sizes on the export page, fixes #1640. [Iglocska]
- Added new feature to block attributes from IDS sensitive exports based
  on proposals. [Iglocska]

  - Enabled via a new server setting (MISP.proposals_block_attributes)
  - Attributes are skipped from exports that require the to_ids flag if:
    - they have an active proposal that proposes to remove the to_ids flag
    - they have an active proposal that proposes to delete the attribute

  - Currently affected exports:
    - OpenIOC
    - All HIDS exports
    - All NIDS exports
    - All text exports
    - RPZ Zone file export

Changes
~~~~~~~

- Remove obsolete variables. [Andreas Ziegler]
- Remove obsolete dropIndex() [Andreas Ziegler]

  not needed for reference, as there's a duplicate in AppModel.php (& in git)

Fix
~~~
- PyMISP to the latest version. [Alexandre Dulaunoy]
- Fixed an issue with an incorrect condition on the admin index.
  [Iglocska]
- Increased space between taxonomy names in the treemap as some of them
  can be quite long. [Iglocska]
- PyMISP updated to the latest version. [Alexandre Dulaunoy]
- PyMISP updated to the latest version. [Alexandre Dulaunoy]
- MISP name fixed. [Alexandre Dulaunoy]
- Fixed annoying capitalisation mess in the event index parameters.
  [Iglocska]

  - just throw everything to lowercase
- Fixed an invalid path for attribute downloads, fixes #1647. [Iglocska]
- Fixed some merge issues. [Iglocska]
- Fixes an invalid check allowing user profile modifications to target
  different users within the org. [Iglocska]

  - User edit had an incorrect check that allowed a normal user edit on a different account within the same org
  - Also removed the deprectated option for this function to be used by org/site admins to be used as an alternative to the admin edit

  - as reported by: Vytautas Paulikas and Robert Giruckas from SEC Consult.
- Attempted fix for an issue with large stix exports getting truncated.
  [Iglocska]

  before trying to read it, fixes MISP/misp-taxonomies#45. [Iglocska]

  - not having any paste/file upload in an import module would fail
    - removed the requirement to have either filled, if a module doesn't use any of the two fields it will simple pass an empty data field
    - this could be handy for modules that create event data based on the userconfig fields
- Fixes an issue where attachments / malware samples were erroneously
  coloured white. [Iglocska]

  - placeholder hard-coded white class replaced with dynamic value
  - Can't check the referenced issue, shame on Norwegian.no for claiming to have wi-fi onboard...

  - could be reused in the future for similar use-cases
- Fixed a UI issue with proposals and links, fixes #1624. [Iglocska]

  - fixed an issue where link type attribute values were not visible due to links being too similar of a colour to the blue background of attributes with indicators
- Better fix than the previous one. [Iglocska]
- Fixed a potential empty event_id field that blocked new CSV feeds from
  being added. [Iglocska]
- Removed double sanitisation of the resolved attributes. [Iglocska]

  loading all eligible events in one go into memory. [Iglocska]

  piling up. [Iglocska]

  - due to a bug, each change in the server settings with an auth plugin enabled would reappend the full list of enabled auth plugins to Security.auth
  - this lead to an exponential growth of the number of entries in the array in the config file

  Bell]

  message saying that it was deleted similar to the event deletion is

- Use php5-redis package instead of pecl for deb7/ubu14. [Andreas
  Ziegler]
- Submodule updates: force overwrite. [Andreas Ziegler]
- Several fixes to the sharing group behavious. [Iglocska]

  - New setting roaming:
    - Until now, users could unselect "Limit instances to which data in this sharing group should be pushed to"
    - This lead to no servers added to the distribution list, and MISP would simply determine, based on the sync rules, whether the host organisation of the remote instance is eligible for the event
    - This works well in most cases, but in some cases, the local instance is not kept after a sync (aliases for the local instance baseurl vs remote instance's view of the url)
    - In these cases the sharing groups ended up being "unlimited", which was not the intent
    - Generally this shouldn't cause any issues as MISP still requires the sync link's organisation to be directly contained in an SG before it would push the event further
    - However, introducing the roaming setting this can be more clearly defined
    - By default, sharing groups are set to non roaming

  - Some further fixes to the sharing group update procedure for 2.4.49

  - Update the roaming status of existing sharing groups. Local sharing groups with no instances attached will become roaming by default, all others are assumed to be non-roaming
- Add own org of sync user to the Sharing group if the sync user is in
  no way contained in the sharing group. [Iglocska]

  - This situation should normally only occur during a pull when the remote end has a sharing group that allows access for all local orgs
- Progress on the sharing group fix for pulled server based sharing
  groups. [Iglocska]
- Cleanup of some messy function call parameters. [Iglocska]
- Fixed an issue where a MISP.org setting with non alphanumeric
  characters could lead to invalid STIX document generation. [Iglocska]
- Added taxonomies/delete to the ACL component. [Iglocska]
- Added functionality to remove taxonomies, fixes #1365. [Iglocska]
- Allow null values for taxonomies expanded column, fixes #1354.
  [Andreas Ziegler]
- Tightened lookups for the addTag / removeTag APIs. [Iglocska]

  - no longer a substring match, users have to specify the full tag name
- Add perm_delegate to MYSQL.sql. [Andreas Ziegler]
- Remove SET from sql ADD column statement. [Andreas Ziegler]
- Update mysql structure for 2.4.49 updates. [Andreas Ziegler]
- Specify correct&specific branches in .gitmodules. [Andreas Ziegler]
- Additional chars =~ in mail address regex. [Andreas Ziegler]
- Use different variable name in sub-loop. [Andreas Ziegler]
- Check for correct event uuid and id. [Andreas Ziegler]
- Fixed an issue where an event view by a malformed UUID would result in
  a lookup against the leading numerical value in the malformed UUID,
  fixes #1338. [Iglocska]
- Add warninglist tables to MYSQL.sql. [Andreas Ziegler]
- Use same default value as in AppModel update mechanism. [Andreas
  Ziegler]
- Tag keywords in attribute search filter has issues with an empty
  newline, fixes #1330. [Iglocska]
- Fixed leading/trailing white spaces from breaking the quick filter on
  the event index, fixes #1329. [Iglocska]
- Fixed an issue with an invalid offset in a comparison when adding
  events. [Iglocska]
- Removed duplicate of the same condition. [Iglocska]
- Filtering on attributes in the event view gives a no attributes
  warning if a tab doesn't contain attributes. [Iglocska]

  - Warning now only triggers if the event doesn't have any attributes in any tabs
- Throw exception for malformed xml file. [Andreas Ziegler]
- Set default value for realFileName. [Andreas Ziegler]
- Throw exception if necessary config cant be read. [Andreas Ziegler]
- Fixed two issues for API add event corner cases, fixes #1298.
  [Iglocska]

  - Correctly handle old style creator org fields ("orgc":orgc_string)
  - Correctly handle new tags with no colour set
- Follow up to the previous patch, same thing for log searches.
  [Iglocska]
- Move case statement and add break. [Andreas Ziegler]
- Fixed an issue with org admins having too much access via the logs.
  [Iglocska]
- Organisations updated with no changes cause erroneous log entries,
  fixes #1099. [Iglocska]
- Allow the export of an empty event in MISP JSON/XML format, fixes
  #1295. [Iglocska]
- Fixed an issue that caused MISP's capture org to disambiguate on the
  name instead of the UUID in some cases. [Iglocska]

  - Due to a fallback mechanism the disambiguation happened on the name if there was no UUID match during the saving of an event instead of creating a new organisation. This was an issue if a remote org changed UUID for example.
- Added domain|ip to the OpenIOC export. [Iglocska]

  - also, the new system should be much easier to extend with new mapping options and is generally a lot cleaner.
  - It would be more complete if Airbus wouldn't have skimped on power outlets on the A380s....
- Rework of the IOC export component, fixes #1292. [Iglocska]
- Ambiguous order field fixed, fixes REST sort of index. Fixes #1266.
  [Iglocska]

  - Fixes an issue where viewing the index of an instance remotely returns no events if sorted on a field.
  - This was caused by some ambiguous field names (such as ID)
  - Fixed by prepending the sorted field name by "Event."
- Fixed an issue with the attribute search incorrectly showing org
  admins the edit button for attributes they don't own, fixes #1278.
  [Iglocska]

  - Also added a way to propose directly from the attribute list / search results
- Empty comments may be added to events #1263. [Iglocska]

  - moved to plain jquery
  - check on back+frontend
  - better responses when adding events
  - fixed an issue with the org_id not being selected for posts
- Fixed a notice error with the attribute pagination. [Iglocska]
- Reverted previous change. [Iglocska]
- Secureauth removed from the config dump. [Iglocska]
- Old upgrade SQL script moved to legacy directory. [Alexandre Dulaunoy]
- Removal of unused file. [Alexandre Dulaunoy]
- Removed the field restrictions from the save() calls in the certauth
  plugin. [Iglocska]

  - apparently cakephp also removes those fields from the beforevalidation hook, meaning that a plugin can potentially escape any data consolidation methods. Not sure if this is intended behaviour by cakephp...
- Fix to an issue with default values not set by the beforeValidate of
  users. [Iglocska]
- Case-insensitive functions calls. [Andreas Ziegler]
- Removed some useless loops, fixes #1231. [Iglocska]
- Reverted the change from addslashes -> escapeshellargs. Will revisit
  the reason it was causing the uploads to fail at a later point in
  time. [Iglocska]
- Multiple values for the restsearch quickfilter added. [Iglocska]
- Proposals now have the correct page title. [Iglocska]

- Allow empty events in pull since they are pushed and importable.
  [Steve Fossen]

  Pulling events from a MISP instance didn't match the events imported from that same MISP instance export, nor did it match events published onto that MISP instance and viewable.

  Events without attributes:
      1) can be pushed
      2) imported
      3) exported

  the tag and its delete button. [Iglocska]

v2.4.46 (2016-05-23)
--------------------

New
~~~
- Added Statixtics for taxonomy and tag usage, fixes 1158. [Iglocska]

Changes
~~~~~~~
- Tiny fix to an if statement. [Iglocska]
- Added sort by value or name option for tag statistics API. [Iglocska]

  - usage: mymisp/tags/tagStatistics/[percentage]/[name-sort]
    - both percentage and name-sort accept true/false
    - false is always the default setting
    - percentage set to true will show the tags by % instead of a count

  - better handling of arrays returned, can still use improvements
- Organisation filter field was case sensitive. Fixed. [Iglocska]

  - New permission flag: perm_tag_editor
    - taggers can tag events with existing tags
    - tag editors can create / edit / delete tags

  - Fixed several misleading UI elements for tagging
    - tagging users that don't own an event and aren't creators thereof cannot tag them
    - this was enforced before but the UI elements were present and threw errors

  - Migration is automatic
    - all existing tagger roles will automatically become tag editors
    - restricting current roles takes manual admin action, but the functionality should remain unchanged for those that just update
- Case insensitive tagname lookup for the addtag / removetag APIs.

v2.4.31 (2016-03-30)
--------------------
- Fix to an issue with the password reset breaking the credentials.
  [Iglocska]

  - The password change forced on users by administrators couldn't save new passwords
  - instead it reset the password to a new random password

  - Resetting the password of such users via the admin interface should fix the issue
  - Alternatively manually setting the password also fixes it
- Re-enabled the missing poporvers on relations. [Iglocska]
- Fixed some issues with the hover enrichment modules. [Iglocska]
- Some refactoring of the freetext tool. [Iglocska]
- Handling of the "freetext" return format via the enrichment modules,
  and error handling fixed. [Iglocska]

  - freetext is now a valid return format, it will allow module developers to return an unparsed text blob which MISP will try to loop through the freetext import's detection mechanism
  - still a lot of improvements to be done for the detection mechanism

  - error handling for modules, instead of discarding errors they are now shown as a flash message on the freetext import result screen
- Unpublish event if the published flag is not set during an edit.
  [Iglocska]

  edit organisation action would leave the user with an unpopulated
  country list. [Iglocska]

  - on the event view, attributes with enrichment options have a new action
    - depends on the choices resolved from /modules from the enrichment service

v2.4.25 (2016-03-09)
--------------------
- Scheduled push incorrectly used the user e-mail address instead of a
  user object to initiate the sync, fixes #1000. [Iglocska]


v2.4.24 (2016-03-07)
--------------------
- Version bump. [Iglocska]
- Better feedback on the sync connection test. [Iglocska]

  - sync users that have not accepted the terms / have had a password reset initiated were redirected to the login page

  - fixes to the issue
    - if a user with automation/sync access uses the API and gets blocked because the terms weren't accepted or there is a pending password change they will be notified in a JSON/XML response
    - the sync test now takes this into consideration starting with this version and will report the cause of the failure

  - Both instances have to be 2.4.24+ for this to be reported correctly
- More flexibility when editing events via the REST API. [Iglocska]

  - Change the distribution / sharing group with a simple payload

- Slightly better error reporting for GPG diagnostic issues. [Iglocska]
- All events quick filter added to event index, fixes #950. [Iglocska]
- Event Tag numbering fixed. [Iglocska]

  - When fetching events, non exportable tags are blocked at a tag level
  - this results in some empty eventTags, which were correctly unset
  - however, this resulted in an associative array instead of an indexed one in the exports

  - fixed by reindexing the eventTags
- If a user is disabled then he should not receive mass admin e-mails.
  [Iglocska]

  - however, if an admin specifically chooses to e-mail him/her it will still work
- Fixed an issue that blocked the editing of attributes in unpublished
  events if the MISP.unpublishedprivate setting was set. [Iglocska]

- Check "Encode Attachments" box on default, fixes #947. [Iglocska]
- Version bump. [Iglocska]
- Reverted a version fix within the XML file. [Iglocska]

  - needs further fixes, sadly the version has always just showed the major and minor version in the exports
  - This masked an issue that would block the import of events that are even a hotfix away

  - As a temporary fix, I reverted the changes and the XML version field will now only show the major and minor version to restore compatibility (so 2.4.0 instead of 2.4.19)
- Fix to the issues with the proposals. [Iglocska]

  - proposals on REST edit could get added without an event_ID / attached to the incorrect event if certain conditions were met
  - removed proposal from event edit completely, as it goes against the intended functionality of out of bounds proposal management

  - also added an update script that removes the invalid proposals
    - these will automatically be rescyncronised on the next pull/push

  220: + pip install redis
- Major speed boost to the correlation. [Iglocska]

  - until now it was assumed that the dirs are already created

  - it was erroneously looking up servers that have push enabled instead of pull


v2.4.3 (2015-12-27)
-------------------
- Rework of the contributor field, some MYSQL.sql tweaks. [iglocska]

  - added indeces to the MYSQL.sql file
  - contributors now looks for shadow attributes instead of log entries (should make the event view much faster and resolve some timeout issues on sync when the log is massive)


v2.4.2 (2015-12-26)
-------------------
- Fixes a bug on invalid event IDs passed to the STIX export causing
  long execution times, fixes #747. [iglocska]

  - Running a stix export for a specific ID that doesn't exist results in a full STIX export for the user (events visible to the user)
  - This leads for an unnecesarily long export process when a quick export is expected


v2.4.1 (2015-12-26)
-------------------
- Several fixes to the exports, fixes #790. [iglocska]

  - New generic fetch attribute method was mistakenly using the order field as a condition, resulting in some exports only displaying a subset of the data
    - the fix to this fixes the issue described in #790 for text exports
  - Fix to the RPZ exports not working correctly
  - Fix to the horrible performance of RPZ exports
  - Fix to several background worker issues with exports

- Removed obsolete news page from the side menu, fixes #780. [iglocska]
- CSV memory usage reduction on automation. [iglocska]

  - reduced the number of attributes at the cost of some additional processing time
  - this should reduce very slow processing of large data sets
- Fixed a serious issue with the snort/suricata export which would keep
  appending all eligible attributes over and over to the file instead of
  properly fetching them event by event resulting in a massive export
  file. [iglocska]
- More graceful handling of pgp errors in the emailer. [iglocska]

  - until now the encryption of emails happened in a try catch block
  - however, crypt_gpg throws a fatal error instead of an exception, killing the background worker

  - added an extra checking algorithm that will test the key for a valid encryption key (encryption enabled + not expired)
  - if it's not there, it will just log an error message and continue execution of the other e-mails
- Event tags correctly saved on rest add if they are set in the
  compressed format (event->tag instead of event->eventtag->tag)
  [iglocska]
- When adding/editing a sync user, the choice to limit a user by
  instance settings shows empty lines for instances without a name.
  [iglocska]

  - use the URL in those cases instead
- Editing an event via REST would not capture the tags. [iglocska]

  - if a user is a tagger the tag should be created (if not existing on the current instance) and added to the event
- Merge branch '2.4' of https://github.com/MISP/MISP into 2.4.

  - the process of detecting and editing existing attributes did not account for a case where the uuid is not set for an attribute and therefore should be saved as a new attribute. Fixed
- Fix for an issue with event edits containing a new attribute and it
  not getting an ID as expected. [Iglocska]
- Taxonomies update. [Iglocska]

  - users can now add taxonomy tags separately from normal tags on the event view
  - tag index now shows taxonomy
- Fix to logging causing certain functions to fail on migrated
  installations. [Iglocska]
- Blocked the colour update when the taxonomies are updated. [Iglocska]

  - site admins can update taxonomy libraries
  - list taxonomies / view indvidual ones (with all resolved tags)

  - It seems like relying on the Accept header can lead to the data type detection failing when accessing .json extension views
  - this issue seems to have gone unnoticed since until now the data passed to the json view was the same as that passed to the html view

  - each time an event is published, MISP will use ZMQ's PUB feature to push out a MISP JSON package using the "misp_json" prefix
- Some merge issues resolved. [Iglocska]
- Merge branch 'feature/rpz' into hotfix-2.3.86. [Iglocska]

  Conflicts:
  	app/Console/Command/EventShell.php
  	app/Model/Server.php
- Opened up the rpz API for automation. [iglocska]
- Merge branch 'master' into feature/rpz. [iglocska]
- Small fixes. [iglocska]

  - filename fix
  - per event download fixed
- Added the missing ways to exploit the rpz functionality. [iglocska]

  - rpz added to exports, both old-style and with background workers
  - per event rpz functionality added
- First revision of the RPZ export complete. [iglocska]

  - documented in automation view
  - right now it follows the simple rule of user > admin settings > default values when generating the export
  - Parameters can be passed via url / JSON object / XML object
  - filters include filter on event ID, date range, tags

  TODO:
  - buttons for a per event download via the UI
  - introduce new export option for normal users (via background workers and the old style export)
- Further progress, still rough around the edges. [iglocska]

  - server settings and validation work
  - configurable template via settings
  - configurable via API as well

  - Also trying to define the structure for future Plugin settings
  - The idea is to have them in a separate tab all prepended with the plugin name
  - since this is not yet part of the future flexible plugin system, it is still kept in the main codebase, but the idea is to get the naming conventions ready for the future version
- First version of the RPZ export. [iglocska]

  - still undocumented
  - very naive policy settings
  - limit per event / tags / date range
- Removed some junk. [Iglocska]
- PGP key selection on fetch, fixes #554. [Iglocska]

  - MISP will now fetch a list of all keys matching the e-mail address from the MIT server from the user edit view
  - A popup will present all the matching keys (with the creation date, key ID, email addresses associated - and the fingerprint when hovering over them)
  - Once the admin clicks on one, it will fetch the desired key

  - future enhancement possibility: move the second stage (the actual key fetch) to the server side instead of a direct ajax query from the user's browser

  #502, fixes #499. [iglocska]

  - this commit is mostly here to capture what was changed in hotfix 2.3.69

  - e-mailing completely reworked, all e-mails now flow through the same method
  - that method will handle all encryption and the decisions whether to send e-mails unencrypted to users without an encryption key, whether to keep the body of the e-mail untruncated, etc
  - all e-mails are now also logged here (including the reason of a potential failure)

  - new server settings for default template messages for password resets / new user welcome messages

  - admin e-mail interface reworked and org admins now also have access to the features

  - password resets / new user for site and org admins (where applicable) - quickly reset the password of a user and alert them using the pre-defined reset template

  =====

  - Tuned the freetext import to really accept free-text. Let me know if you have any tips for tuning the detection further!

  - it now breaks the passed string on whitespace and line-break and tries to resolve the rest. Filename resolution tightened to exclude anthing that starts or ends with a .
- Blackhole message due to csrf replaced with something more obvious,
  fixes #504. [iglocska]

  - user will get an explanation of the csrf error and that going back and refreshing the form will fix it

- New emailer finished. [iglocska]
- Further progress. [iglocska]
- Rework of the e-mailing, part 1. [iglocska]

  - Reworking the way e-mails are sent - all of it goes through a centralised e-mail method
  - just pass the recipient, recipient encryption key collection, body, alternate body if the message cannot be encrypted, subject, reply to address and pgp key for reply to along and the method will do the rest

  - encrypt if possible, check if sending without encryption is allowed, signing, adding attachment for reply to encryption key, using alternate sanitised body if it is enforced for accounts that cannot use encryption is all done in one place

  - easy to maintain and expand with future changes (such as the S/MIME pull request on github)

- Fixed broken AJAX queries in MISP as a result to changes in cakephp
  2.4.8+ [iglocska]

  A change in cakephp version 2.4.8+ has resulted in ajax form submitions breaking. Reason for this was a change in the SecurityComponent taking the url specified in the form into account when generating the CSRF tokens.

- Merge branch 'hotfix-2.1.8' into develop. [iglocska]
- Upgrade script for 2.1.8. [iglocska]

  - we have introduced the "locked" flag for events to protect events of the original creator from being edited by a sync user

  - IMPORTANT: before running the script below, make sure to create the locked field for the event table (see INSTALL/LOCKED.sql)

  - This script (generateLocked found in the Administrative tools menu) will attempt to set the locked value for existing events to ease the transition

  - The default value for locked is 0, and all events created on the instance should be set to this value

  - events that were synced from another instance should have their locked value set to 1

  - this script checks for local organisations and sets the locked field to 1 for all events not created by them

  - a local organisation, as defined for the scope of this scrips is: an organisation with at least 2 members or an organisation with a single member that is not a sync user.

  - The script is only accessible by site admins and will return a notification about the number of events altered.

- Attribute http-method added - issue #161 fixed. [Alexandre Dulaunoy]

  is case sensitive.
- Terms and conditions separated from the template. [Alexandre Dulaunoy]

  basis, with the setting "ALL" affecting all attributes

  - creation / deletion of several attributes in one edit to accommodate
  for several checked type options

  databases

  - Some feedback on what got changed during a perform on all

  - UI changes in the index / regexp add / edit views to reflect the type
  sensitivity changes
- Removal of the blacklist. [iglocska]

  - Since regexp can be used to blacklist things, there's no need to have
  two separate features that accomplish the same thing

  - Add a regexp named /1.1.1.1/ with nothing as replacement and it will
  behave the same as adding a blacklist for 1.1.1.1 in the old system.
- Bug in a previous commit. [iglocska]

  - left in some debug used to escape php encryption during testing

- Regexp changes, UI changes. [iglocska]

  - The side menu is now fixed / relatively positioned based on the debug
  mode, like the header and the footer.
- Some changes to the UI. [iglocska]

  - The previous UI changes fixed the top and the bottom bar to the
  viewport

  - It was great for the UI with the debug disabled, but it obstructed the
  debug info with it on

  - now, turning debug off fixes the top bar and the bottom bar, turning
  it on returns it to the top and bottom of the page, as it was in earlier
  versions

- Several copy paste failures fixed in the previous commit. [iglocska]

  - /facepalm
- ACL checks changed. [iglocska]

  - until now checkAction was used to check permissions of a user

  - but since all of the role permissions are checked beforefilter in
  appcontroller and saved into a public array, doing a lookup of the
  array saves an SQL call for each permission check.
- Closes #131. [iglocska]

  - Seems like a change removed this functionality since 2.0, fixed

  - whitelist checks are to be applied on almost all exports
  (implementation in progress)
  - the exception will be the search result exports, if the (to be
  implemented) to_ids only checkbox isn't checked

- Grouped documentation. [Christophe Vandeplas]
- Removed warning message. [Christophe Vandeplas]
- Update to the attribute search. [iglocska]

  - Use ! to exclude terms in the value/id/org fields

  - org search works the same way as value / id now, you can enter several
  terms separated by a newline. Also, adding ! infront of a term will
  exclude the organisation from the results

  - sub string search for organisations
- Consistency in MYSQL database file. [Christophe Vandeplas]
- Unify db schema. [Christophe Vandeplas]
- Filter logic reworked. [iglocska]

  - Affects org and info field

  - terms have to be saparated by pipe (|)

  - terms can be terms that will be OR-d or excluded terms that will be
  AND-ed

  - to exclude a term use !

  - A valid filter search for info would be: 'term1|term2|!term3'
  -> this would result in all events with the info field containing term1
  or term2 but not term3
- NOT filter for orgs on the event index. [iglocska]

  - entering for example '!futuremark' would exclude all events created by
  the organisation 'futuremark'
- Email addresses of event creators visible to users if same org.
  [iglocska]

  - On the event index, users can view the e-mail address of the event
  creator, if the event belongs to their own organisation
- Some fixes to the filters event index. [iglocska]

  - siteadmins can now search the creator org instead of the owner org
  (like normal users would)

  - Changed the org search to be a partial match instead of an exact match
- Two small changes. [Iglocska]

  - email of the user creating an event shown if current user's org ==
    event's orgc

  - on export, the check for to_ids will happen outside of the if branch
    that sets extra restrictions of non site admins. Otherwise site-admins
    would accidentally include attributes that aren't iocs.
- Fix to the filters on IE. [Iglocska]

  - old versions of IE didn't handle an incorrect form creation as gracefully as the other browsers

  - forms should not be created within a table unless it's within a <td> (it was
    on <tr> level before). The normal solution would be to encapsulate the
    entire table in a form, but since we have formlinks for the deletes /
    publishes this would get flagged as form tampering by the security
    components.

  - As a fix, filter forms are created separately for the 4 search fields within their <td> now with hidden fields that keep the persistence of the previously
    entered filter terms
- Incorrect line removed from migration. [iglocska]
- Update to the migration. [iglocska]
- First update to the SQL scripts. [iglocska]
- Wrong file included in previous commit. [iglocska]

  e-mail when a proposal is made to it
  - Default setting for the new field is 0, if a shadow attribute is
  added an e-mail is sent to all subscribing members of the orgc and the
  new field is set to 1
  - Accepting a change resets the field to 0
- Extra access control restriction for reportValidationIssues.

  - upgrade scripts finish gracefully
- Small change to the migration. [iglocska]
- Change to the migration script fixing an error. [iglocska]

  During the structure export of the ACL tables the current increment count
  from the test environment got left in, caused errors when creating a new
  role.
- Instructions for the upgrade. [iglocska]

  - 1st version
- Update to generateCount. [iglocska]

  - generateCount used to just run through all attributes and save them, to
    generate the count. It led to VERY long execution times on larger
    databases (25k+ attributes). With the extra processing that each save()
    does for attributes, this was horribly slow.

  - new generateCount just saves the events based on the number of
    associated attributes, only having to save the events (of which there
    are considerably less).
- More updates to the migration. [iglocska]
- Slight change to generating the ArosAcos. [iglocska]

    fetching the info field through a js rest request was annoyingly slow

  - some coding standards
- Attribute and event access. [Andras Iklody]

  - Updated the check for authorisation to view an event and attribute as
    the system hid some valid combinations (such as a server only attribute
    in a higher distribution level event).
- Regexp validation. [Andras Iklody]

  - an invalid regexp entry could block any event/attribute from being
    entered. Introduced a check on regexp entry to block faulty patterns.

  Iklody]

  - List of new values for the regexp table

  - if the user_id for an event is not set, set it to that of the user with
    the e-mail address of 'cisprotection@ncirc.nato.int'.
- Colouring of search terms works in links. [Andras Iklody]

  - links now have proper colouring to make the found terms more visible
- Some changes to the search. [Andras Iklody]

  - changes to the validation of the results

  - fixes an issue where the escaping of slashes showed up with a //

  - made the found results more visible and case insensitive
- Slight update to the filename regex. [Andras Iklody]

  - accept extensions from 2 to 4 characters in length
- Fixed some regex issues and file name validation. [Andras Iklody]

  - Fixed an issue that caused attribute values to be converted to 1 on
    save in case of an empty regexp table

    sanitization
- Checkbox / radio misalignment. [Andras Iklody]

  - Fixed an issue with IE interpretting an unset padding value for
    checkboxes / radio selects as a good reason to give it some high value.

  - Fixed a bug with editing attributes
- Still issues with the attribute search. [Andras Iklody]

  - should be ok now
- Fix to the updated search attributes. [Andras Iklody]

  - issue on the live server with the search field left empty, fixed
- Several things (search, migration) [Andras Iklody]

  - Changes to the default setting for non private events after migration

  - search attribute update to be able to exclude events
- Updated the migration script (SQL) [Andras Iklody]

  - Script updated based on the issues during testing

  - Changed the file upload/downoad mechanism.
- Composite type change. [Andras Iklody]

  - composite type's value not exploded if value1 already set (to hopefully
    fix issues with the migration tool)
- Missing migration sql updates. [Andras Iklody]
- Regexp fixed. [Andras Iklody]

  - Regexp replacement didn't actually change the data in the object. Fixed.

  - comma at the end of line missing in SQL file
- Changes to the distribution handling of attributes. [Andras Iklody]

  - Only the creating org of the event can change the distribution of
    attributes

  - Attribute distribution setting are only pushed on edits if they were
    manually changed (so that the distribution level of events on the
    creating server doesn't get degraded by an edit and push of the event at
    a synced server when using connected community settings).

  - slight change to the batch attribute search, the search terms are only
    echoed up to 9 terms to prevent the mass echoing of a long list
- Some updates to the migration script. [Andras Iklody]

  - Getting it up to date
- Attribute edit fixed. [Andras Iklody]

  - Editing attributes caused an error because the uuid was not passed back
    from the form (and it is used to find the attribute locally for rest)

  - UUID is now used from the read attribute for non rest users. In the long
    run it would be cleaner to not allow non rest users to reach that part
    of the code.
- Minor changes. [Andras Iklody]

  - some changes to the access control

  - re-renabled regexp and blacklists, will need a closer look though

  - editing a role should update ACL

  - some other minor things
- Previous commit was slightly off. [Andras Iklody]

  Changed the placing of the unset, as it broke the push of attachments.
  Should be fine now.
- Major bug with attributes disappearing during sync. [Andras Iklody]

  Found a bug where an instance that has a lower attribute count pushing to
  another would cause the attributes with equal attribute ID to get
  overwritten with the pushed ones. Unsetting the attribute ID before the
  push fixes this.
- Update to the menu. [Andras Iklody]

  - minor cosmetic change
- Reworked the sync / release control. [Andras Iklody]

  - Fixed issues with the sync
  	- Secondary publishes on remote servers failed
  	- Introduced new fields in events to stop backward traverse of
  	  edit information that lead to low performance and eroneous
  	  distribution information updates when more than 2 servers were
  	  linked
  	- Deletion of an attribute now deletes on remote servers

  - Changes to the event ownership
  	- Original creator org now noted in the event itself
  	- Only original creator org can change distribution
  	- Events will show up with the original creator org for users
  	  (admins can see both that and the owner of the event on the
  	  local instance)
  	- Server.organization now used in junction with the connecting
  	  user's org and the instance's org (from the bootstrap) to
  	  determine distribution flow control and access rights

    removed, etc.
- Missing file from the last commit. [Andras Iklody]

  Missed a file from the package
- Fixes to access rights, some sanitization, etc. [Andras Iklody]

  - Admins cannot manually change anyone's authkey, they need to generate a
    new one via the reset link

  - Some pages could be accessed by changing the url - fixed (though needs
    further testing)

  - Edited a change in the manual that may have been confusing

  - Some changes to the way ACL is set up - still needs more work

  'WINNT'

  Also removed autofill for the login field
- Corrected a typo preventing the sync from working. [Andras Iklody]
- Changes to the admin org access and sanitization. [Andras Iklody]

  1. Some errors fixed in the way redirects worked for org admins

  2. fixed some double sanitization resulting in incorrect characters

  Hovering over the event IDs now shows the event info in the list generated
  by the search attributes page

  Subject: Re: sync/REST
  Date: Fri, 7 Dec 2012 13:30:10 +0000
  in this there is a complaint about the RESTfull sync workings.
  the email hints about 2 possible options:
  i) RESTfull add event without attributes (conform the web interface)
  ii) RESTfull add event with attributes (more conform the code)

  both are implemented and can be choisen in bootstrap.php by
  Configure::write('CyDefSIG.rest', 'ii') or 'i'.

- Better placement of plugins (touching RBAC & Audit log) [noud]

  If it's just an existing behavior or lib,
  place it in a plugin directory structure in <cydefsig>/plugins.

  If there is a need to change an extern existing plugin,
  extend the existing plugin by a new plugin in <cydefsig>/app/Plugin.

  This way there is a very clean devision between own and external code.
  The external code can be updated without touching own nor changed code.

  During sync and correlation = db,
  an attachment or malware did not get processed into
  Attribute.data, so will not be synced.
  Now, conform other correlation methods being 'default' or 'sql'
  the attachment or malware is synced as well.
  (master has been synced with mil.be not using db correlation,
  so should have the data.)
- NIAS. [noud]

  CyDefSIG.showowner=false, to not show email.

  To test it's handy to run a virtual hosted CyDefSIG having it's own

  This is the Apache virtual host setup.
- Sync. [noud]

  Example data describing the NATO CyDefSIG server.
- Sync. [noud]

  The actual logos used for visable flags in Events::index.
- Sync. [noud]

  Sync worked, but we did not know what to do with user_id and org.
  Now, on sync, anonymize the user_id, get the Server.organization and put
  that into Event.org.
  And, display owning flag if Event.user_id or get the Server.logo
  belonging to Event.org (=Server.organization) when Event.user_id is
  empty (=0).

  To this there is organization name and logo in bootstrap and
  other organizations names and logos in Servers.
- Extra bug. [noud]

  Add attribute, do not fill in any, and hit Submit, gives error messages.

  Add attribute, do not fill in any, and hit Submit, did give error

- Correlation. [noud]

  do not use the AttributesController::event now,
  just use the old EventsController::view.
- Use DS in stead of '/'. [noud]
- Delete (published) event or attribute. [noud]

  Previous, upon delete only on the local server the event or attribute
  was deleted.
  Now, if delete, look for same event or attribute (using it's uuid)
  and delete on remote servers as well.
  Also look and delete if not published, so no dangling/zombie copies
  remain on remote servers.
- Authkey validation bug and cleanup of fixed bugs list. [noud]
- Authkey validation. [noud]

  An authkey with any length, so less then 40, could be entered.
  Now authkey has to have a length of 40 (or higher).
- HIDS exports sorted (and small indention correction). [noud]
- Whitelist not on NidsExportComponent::urlRule. [noud]

  In hindsight, an url should not be excluded given a host or domain name.
- Correlation speedup using AttributesController i.s.o.
  EventsController. [noud]

  We forgot to change some view things using the right controller.
- REST edit Event implementation. [noud]

  Now after publish, edit and (re)publish an event,
  that event will be updated on the other servers.
- Event.user_id. [noud]

  Event.user_id was re-added but we still missed some,
  so an added event would get user_id set to zero.
  Now Event gets the correct user_id again from
  the person logged in and adding.
  (lateron this must not be used during sync.)
- Whitelist. [noud]

  Mention the whitelist for NDIS export on Export page.
- Whitelist. [noud]

  An admin can maintain a whitelist of host, domain name and ip numbers.
  In the NIDS export lines containing whitelist items are commented out.
- Correlation performance gain. [noud]

  in Config/bootstrap.php add
  Configure::write('CyDefSIG.correlation', 'sql');

  possible values:
  - default, like it was
  - db, correlation in database
  - sql, selection on attributes i.s.o. per attribute
    (sql improvement possible if result conform db above)

  Network activity, ip-src
  30 class-C network ip addresses
  (7650 tupels) (time in ms)

            default     db    sql
  all         25366  16601  15941
              24839  16604  15611
  paginated   16759   8447   6615

  this is used in both:
  - events/view/<id>
  - attributes/event/<id>
- Bug, unknown server internet name and pull. [noud]
- Fix to pulling from an unknown server. [noud]

  - a server having a non-existing internet name gives
    "php_network_getaddresses:
    getaddrinfo failed: Name or service not known"
    on pull.
- Sync Servers, error if server no MISP or non-existing hostname. [noud]
- Sync Servers, fix if server no MISP or non-existing hostname. [noud]

  - a server containing no MISP gives "XML cannot be read." on publish.
  - a server having a non-existing internet name gives
    "php_network_getaddresses: getaddrinfo failed: Name or service not
  known" on publish.
- Export HIDS files with MD5 and SHA-1. [noud]
- (Audit) logs. [noud]

  The writing of the log in User was done by me using calls to the PHP db
  driver (during my second or third day). Very wrong given that is driver
  and db dependant. Now use CakePHPs calls to have abstraction.
- GFI Sandbox upload. [noud]

  If add event, give a GFI Sandbox export file upload field option.
  Unzip, read .xml, add attachment malware, created files and ip-dst.
- LogableBehavior. [noud]

  removed some debug() and fixed writing to syslog when deleting event
  with attributes.
- Event.user_id rollback(-part). [noud]
