# MISP threat sharing - legal and policy compliance

The MISP project is a large open source project, aiming to support and improve information sharing and threat intelligence analysis at large.

As the MISP project is used in different geographical regions (Europe, North America, Asia-Pacific, South America and Africa) as well as different sectors of activities (spanning a wide selection such as cyber security, intelligence community, law enforcement and NGOs), a set of legal and policy compliance analyses are available to ensure compliance while using the software, documents or libraries contained within the MISP project.
