# Changelog


## v2.4.160 (2022-08-04)

### New

* [diamond-model-for-influence-operations] "The Diamond Model for Influence Operations Analysis" taxonomy added. [Alexandre Dulaunoy]

* [nis2] NIS2 proposal taxonomy. [Alexandre Dulaunoy]

  The taxonomy is meant for large scale cybersecurity incidents, as mentioned in the Commission Recommendation of 13 May 2022, also known as the provisional agreement.
  This proposal is based on the original NIS (machinetag) JSON file with the reflection of NIS2 proposal including changes as:
  - changes in sectors,
  - adding subsectors with detailed description,
  - adding taxonomies for important entities
  - adding subsectors for important entities.
  Work done as part of contribution to EnCaViBS project https://encavibs.uni.lu
  [machinetag2.txt](https://github.com/MISP/misp-taxonomies/files/8948834/machinetag2.txt)

  Contribution from @AMEXTT

### Changes

* [MANIFEST] updated. [Alexandre Dulaunoy]

* [tlp] updating the new version of the traffic light protocol published by FIRST.org. [Alexandre Dulaunoy]

  Some notes concerning the version 2.0 of the tlp taxonomy:

  - A new tag is introduced `TLP:AMBER+STRICT` to clarify the restriction to
  share only with your organisation.
  - A new tag is introduced called `TLP:CLEAR` which seems to replace
  `TLP:WHITE` as it disappears from the version 2.0 of the official TLP
  document.
  - The old tag `TLP:WHITE` is preserved in the taxonomy. As we don't have
  any official reference in the version 2.0 about the compatibility with
  `TLP:CLEAR`, we *assume* it's a synomym from the original `TLP:WHITE`.
  - The old tag `TLP:EX:CHR` is also preserved in the taxonomy for
  backward compatibility.

  We strongly recommend any users using the tlp taxonomy in their tools to review
  workflows and ensure that the new version 2.0 is taken into consideration.

  - `misp:ids="true"` -> set the IDS flag
  - `misp:ids="force"` -> force the use of the ids predicate (over the IDS flag set)
  - `misp:ids="false"` -> unset the IDS flag

  This predicates is not currently used in MISP directly but must be
  used for external tools using it. Those tags can be set at local or
  global level depending of the use-case.

  Updated Taxonomy for Sectors and Digital Services based on the EU NIS Directive. https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32016L1148&from=EN#ntr17-L_2016194EN.01000101-E0017

  Removed entity types that have been misclassified as sub-sectors. If we wanted to include entity types we should have done the same for all subsectors and not selectively for the sectors that do not define subsectors. If this is something that we desire, instead of removing what I have suggested we need to include all the ones that haven't initially.

  Second, the digital service providers in the NIS Directive should not be classified as sectors but as digital services. Normally this would require a new taxonomy of three entities only. I can go both ways.

* Add: [type] Taxonomy to describe different types of intelligence gathering discipline which can be described the origin of intelligence. [Alexandre Dulaunoy]

  This taxonomy has been created for various reasons:

   - For the past years, we have seen a recurring tag called "type:osint"
     actively used by various sharing communities.
   - The Intelligence Community is actively using the information
     gathering classification.

  So we basically merged in the type namespace which has the advantage
  to keep the old free tag "type:osint" valid and get a more consistent approach
  for the overall classification used in information gathering in IC.

* Add: priority-level added in MANIFEST. [Alexandre Dulaunoy]

  After an incident is scored, it is assigned a priority level. The six levels listed below are aligned with NCCIC, DHS, and the CISS to help provide a common lexicon when discussing incidents. This priority assignment drives NCCIC urgency, pre-approved incident response offerings, reporting requirements, and recommendations for leadership escalation. Generally, incident priority distribution should follow a similar pattern to the graph below. Based on https://www.us-cert.gov/NCCIC-Cyber-Incident-Scoring-System.

  TLP and fr-classif updated with exclusive property.

  The exclusive property can be used by the software (e.g. MISP) to warn users
  if (s)he tries to add multiple tags on the same element (attribute, event...).
  It's up to the configuration of the software to enforce it or not.

  By default, tags are not exclusive.

  The challenge when doing such taxonomy is to describes a human process
  into a machine-readable taxonomy. So feedback (via PR or issues)
  is more than welcome.

  A simple JSON format where a vernacular/common name describes

  The format is a simple JSON object with a key for the common name
  which references a list of potential associated machine tags.

  The usage (in a first step) in MISP will be the following:

  - The replacement in the index UI of the corresponding list of machine
    tags by the vernacular/common name.

  - The ability to add automatically associated machine tags when tagging with the
    vernacular/common name.

  Even if the machine tags is not enabled in MISP, the tag will be added.
