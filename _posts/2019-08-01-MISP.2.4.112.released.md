## CVE-2019-14286 fixed

[CVE-2019-14286](https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2019-14286) has been fixed. In app/webroot/js/event-graph.js in MISP 2.4.111, a stored XSS vulnerability exists in the event-graph view when a user toggles the event graph view. A malicious MISP event must be crafted in order to trigger the vulnerability. This vulnerability has been fixed in MISP 2.4.112. We strongly encourage everyone to update as soon as possible. Thanks to David Heise who reported the vulnerability.

## misp-modules

Documentation has been also improved (thanks to all the contributors who helped us on the documentation).
