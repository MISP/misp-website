A new version of MISP [2.4.78](https://github.com/MISP/MISP/tree/v2.4.77) has been released including an important security fix (if you use sharing groups), multiple bug fixes and some new functionalities.

A security fix in in the attribute lookup in the UI to correctly adhere to the sharing group. Thanks to Helge Aksdal for pointing this out. 

MISP roles can now be managed from the API directory. roles functions like add, delete, index, list and set_default are now accessible via the API. The current HEAD of PyMISP includes the roles support.

Multiple bugs in the UI and API were fixed in this release.

A new attribute type 'cookie' has been added. A more complex [MISP object cookie](https://github.com/MISP/misp-objects/blob/master/objects/cookie/definition.json) is now available in the templates and will be accessible in the next release which will include the MISP objects. For the curious, the branch `objects_wip` is the current development activities to support the MISP objects. This also a last-call for the contributors who need some additional objects (before a first release is done) to review the [current MISP object templates](https://github.com/MISP/misp-objects).

Various improvements have been made to make lookups, export and API lookups of attribute level data.

MISP taxonomies, galaxies and PyMISP updated to the latest version.
