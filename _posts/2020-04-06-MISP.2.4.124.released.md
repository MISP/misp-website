# MISP 2.4.124 released

A new version of MISP ([2.4.124](https://github.com/MISP/MISP/tree/v2.4.123)) has been released. This version includes various improvements including a new multiline widgets in the dashboard, auditing improvements and many bugs fixed.

# Dashboard and widget improved

The dashboard has been improved along with a host of bugs fixed. A UI for the multiline widget has been introduced.

# (auditing) Individual user monitoring

- Site admins can set the monitoring flag on a user if the feature is enabled on the instance
- Monitored users will have all requests logged along with POST bodies
- Keep in mind this functionality is quite heavy and intrusive - so use it with care. The idea is that this allows us to track potentially malicious users during an investigation

# New community CogSec Collab disinformation

MISP includes the possibility to advertise your MISP information sharing community, don't hesitate to propose your community to gain some visibility. We added "[The Cognitive Security Collaborative operates as a sharing community dedicated to information operations](https://www.misp-project.org/2020/03/26/cogsec-collab-misp-community.html)".

# COVID-19 MISP

COVID-19 MISP is a MISP instance retrofitted for a COVID-19 information sharing community, focusing on two areas of sharing:

- Medical information
- Cyber threats related to / abusing COVID-19

The information sharing community has a low barrier of entry, everyone can contribute and use the data. By default, the information is classified as TLP:WHITE for broader distribution and usefulness.
