# MISP 2.4.127 released

A new version of MISP ([2.4.127](https://github.com/MISP/MISP/tree/v2.4.127)) has been released with an improved version of attributes decaying, new set of widgets, many improvements and bugs fixed.

# Improved decaying of attributes (version 2)

In MISP 2.4.116, a decaying functionality was added to allow users and organisations to easily expire information depending on their personalised objectives and targets.

Based on the feedback of the organisations relying on the decaying feature, the following improvements were included:

- New setting `default_restsearch_parameters` allowing users to supply restSearch parameters that will be automatically be passed during API fetch. The main purpose of this new setting is to enable users to inject filters when integrating with third-party tools not offering the possibility to control the query performed against MISP. For example, it allows to add default decaying parameters to all restSearch query done.

- New setting `tag_numerical_value_override` allowing users to override the `numerical_value` if tags. The main purpose of this new setting is to let users have their own numerical values for tags. It does not constrain site-admin to diverge from the official misp-taxonomy repository, and let them define new values for entries not having one.

## Major changes in decay computation

Attribute's `last_seen` will now takes precedences over the attribute's `timestamp` if the former is set. In the decaying implementation prior to this version, if no sightings were recorded, the simulated last sighting was set on the `timestamp` value. However, in this new version, the `last_seen` value will be used instead. Users will be able to alter attributes (attach tags, modify `last_seen`, ...) without refreshing the decaying score to its maximum value.

# New widgets added to MISP

Additional widgets (contributed by Koen Van Impe) were added in MISP with the following features:

- Widget to display system resources (df, cpu, mem)
- Widget to display the latest sightings
- Widget to display the false positive sightings above certain threshold

Don't hesitate to contribute your own widgets and take a look at the existing ones.

# Various improvements

- [cli] Command for pulling from all remote servers.
- [UI] Add event ID to page table.
- [events:distributionGraph] Added close button in popover.
- [correlations] Refactored correlation saving.
  - Always show other correlating value (useful for CIDR correlations)
  - Make correlation saving faster (move more work to database, do not fetch not necessary fields)
  - Fix some small bugs

Many other improvements are documented in the [complete changelog is available](https://www.misp-project.org/Changelog.txt).
